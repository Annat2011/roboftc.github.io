# RoboFTC Swerve Module

We have designed a swerve module for First Tech Challenge available as a Fusion link.

The module was made to provide a solid example of what a swerve module is designed like and can sweve as inspiration for anyone looking to design and possibly build one.

## How does the module work?

Our swerve module features a single servo and motor for pivoting and powering the wheel, with the servo powering the wheel's rotation and the motor powering the wheel's spin. With the added custom encoder ontop, you can be certain that the rotation of the wheel will be properly tracked. The added ratio to the motor also allows for both strong, but snappy movement across the field.

## Advantages
- Coaxial Servo + Motor Integration
- High-Precision Steering
- Continuous Steering Capability
- Independent Drive and Steering
- Optimized Drive Motor Output
