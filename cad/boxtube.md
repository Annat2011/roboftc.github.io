# RoboFTC Box Tube | Vin - 29692

We have designed a boxtube extension for First Tech Challenge available as a Fusion link.

The boxtube extension was made to provide an easy-to-understand boxtube that could be implemented onto your next robot and can serve as inspiration for anyone looking to design and possibly build one.

## How does the Boxtube work?

The boxtube extension features four-stages of aluminum boxtube all strung together and connected by endstops with the strings having their own guardrails in order to prevent damage and accidental slippage.

## Advantages
- Four Stage Extension Design
- High-Precision Steering
- Integrated Endstops
- String Guardrail System
