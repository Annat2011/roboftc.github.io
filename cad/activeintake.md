# RoboFTC Active Intake Design

We have designed an active intake for the 2024-2025 FTC Robotics Season, Into The Deep available to download as a .step file.

The .step is made to provide an easy way to quickly get started with a bot by offering a well-tested active intake for you team to use and edit.

## How does our active intake work?

Our active intake features both a servo for opening and closing the back hatch to allow samples to pass through along with a geared motor to spin the intake flaps to quickly collect this seasons the game elements from various angles & edges in the submersible and positions the sample for an easy transfer. This intake is also mountable using GoBilda Structural Components for easy integration into designs.
