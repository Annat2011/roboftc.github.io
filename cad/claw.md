# RoboFTC Claw Design | Simon - 16917

We have designed a claw design for the 2024-2025 FTC Robotics Season, Into The Deep, for both Onshape & Fusion available to download as a .step file.

The .step is made to provide an easy way to quickly get started with a bot by offering a well-tested claw for you team to use and edit.

## How does our claws work?

Our claw features a single servo for opening and closing the claw, geared together, having one powered and one passive side. It grasp the game element for this season from the outside edges and hold onto the game element tightly for scoring samples, specimen, or both! The claw is also made very small in order to take up as little room as possible in order to insure it can fit onto your robot very easily. It also feature compatibility with Gobilda parts so teams can easily attach it onto their bot if they utilize GoBilda mounting hardware.
