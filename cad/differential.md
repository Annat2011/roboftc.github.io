# RoboFTC Differential Design | Vin - 29692

We have designed a differential wrist for First Tech Challenge available to download and view as a Fusion 360 link.

The differential wrist is made to provide an easy way to quickly get started with advanced applications of gearing and can used on many parts of your robot.

## How does our differential wrist work?

Our differential wrist features two GoBilda Speed Servos with 3 Axon Bevels for both pivoting movement and rotation movement. Fit in a compact design, the wrist is also very light-weight and has GoBilda Sonic Hub attached to the end for easy mounting of many FTC parts.

## Advantages
- Dual power transmission
- Reduced size
