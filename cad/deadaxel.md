# RoboFTC Dead Axle Design

We have a design a configurable assembly that can be used in onshape (and exported) and a .step avalible to download.  
The .step is made to connect to GoBilda Mecanum Wheels (both regular and GripForce).

## How does a Dead Axel work?

A dead axle setup is a mechanism is mounted on a fixed axle using bearings, allowing the mechanism to spin freely around the axle, the axle itself does not rotate.
They requires power transmission to be directly attached to the mechanism as the axle won't turn the mechanism, making it ideal for situations where you need to power something positioned between two plates, using the axle as a stable support point between them. 

## Advantages
- Simple power transmission
- Can centralize weight distribution
- Axle can be used as a support between plates
- Can require less parts then a live axle setup
- Less maintenance
