# Knock Out (Patent Pending Robot – FTC 11285)

This is the CAD for **FTC Team 11285 PATENT PENDING**’s robot, **Knock Out**, available as a Onshape Link.

It features a pass-through design commonly used in FTC and serves as a great source of inspiration for rookie teams looking to design reliable and competitive mechanisms.

## Drivetrain

This robot features a parallel plate chassis design with GoBilda mecanum wheels on dead axles. Integrated within the chassis are three odometry pods, which aid with localization and consistent autonomous pathing during matches.

## Vertical Lifts

Knock Out uses dual 5-stage Misumi SAR230 linear slides strung in a continuous configuration. These slides are powered by two GoBilda 1150 RPM motors. To reduce motor load and enhance reliability, the system is counter-sprung using bungee cords.

## Depos

The depos arm is driven by a single Axon servo and ends in a claw for specimen placement. The arm utilizes physical hard stops to ensure consistent and reliable transfers. It is mounted on a horizontal extension system powered by a set of two Misumi SAR220 slides and one Axon Max servo. This configuration allows the robot to intake specimens off the field wall and deposit them into the high chamber without rotating the drivetrain.

## Intake

The intake arm is powered by a single Swyft Balance servo, with the wrist also using a Swyft Balance servo. The intake includes a claw with a mounted Limelight 3A, enabling autonomous intake functionality. Both the arm and wrist use ELC analog encoders and physical hard stops to ensure precise, consistent transfers every time.

## Hang

Knock Out features a Level 2 hanging mechanism powered by two Axon Max servos, running in the SPM at a 48:32 gear ratio. Bowden tubes are used to guide the string for a smoother and more reliable hang sequence.

## Advantages

- Effective pass-through design for efficient transfers
- Integrated autonomous-friendly mechanisms (Limelight + odometry)
- Counter-sprung lifts reduce motor load
- Mechanically consistent depos system
- Compact but capable drivetrain layout
