# LCC Winner Bot (Exodus – FTC 30030)

This is the CAD for **FTC Team 30030 EXODUS**’s, **LCC Winner Bot**, available as a Onshape Link.

This robot was made for the 2025 LCC CAD Compeition challenge and won 1st place in the competition!

## Drivetrain

This robot features a parallel plate chassis design with a 6-wheel design for increased speed and torque while driving around the field. The drivetrain is also powered by GoBilda Bare motors to reduce the total weight of the robot.

## Vertical Lifts

Exodus uses dual 3-stage Misumi SAR230 linear slides strung in a continuous configuration. These slides are powered by two GoBilda Bare motors. To reduce motor load and enhance reliability, the system is counter-sprung using bungee cords.

## Horizontal Extension

The horizontal extention was added to speed up cycles by allowing the robot to reach out when grabbing and scoring both minerals and fuel cells, reducing the distance our robot needs to drive.

## Mineral Scorer

The TPU star intake sweepers are meticulously engineered to efficiently capture Minerals as they traverse along the intake bowl.

## Fuel Line Scorer

The claw is designed to securely hold two distinct Fuel Lines simultaneously. Utilizing a four-bar linkage system, it adeptly maneuvers the Fuel Lines through the robot, enabling seamless transfer from one side to the other. Mounted on a virtual four-bar, the claw can be dynamically angled throughout this motion, granting full control over orientation as the Fuel Lines are transferred.

## Advantages

- Lightweight Drivetrain Design
