# Eclipse (Indubitables v1 Robot) | Kuek - 20077

This is the CAD for first robot from the FTC Team 20077, The Indubitables for the 2024-2025 FTC Robotics Season, Into The Deep, available as a Fusion Link.

This robot is meant to give many new rookies and existing teams ideas this season, or seasons beyond, on some ideas you can create or replicate with your robot.

## Drivetrain

This robot features a relatively small drivetrain with a size of 15 inches by 12.5 inches. It features a centralized motor design with dead axle powered wheels. It also utilizes a dual dead wheel design to aid with localization during the autonomous period.

## Outtake

The outtake features 8 sets of Misumi SAR 230 slides powered by a GT2 belt pulley system. The outtake arm is powered by dual servos for max speed and torque when scoring specimen onto the bar. There is also a differential wrist on the end of arm that hold the claw and allows to score specimen backwards, lowering cycle times.

## Intake

The intake is a very similar design to the outtake design of this robot. It also features an arm powered by dual servos for max speed when grabbing samples from the field. It also features a differential wrist to grab various samples at different positions on the field. However, the 6 Misumi SAR 230 slides on the intake are powered by a two-bar linkage system that allows for quick extension and retraction for quick cycle times.

## Advantages
- Small form factor (15 in. x 12.5 in.)
- Simple power transmission throughout the design (Outtake, Intake, Drivetrain)
- Simple, yet effective design
