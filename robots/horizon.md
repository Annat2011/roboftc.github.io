# Horizon (Indubitables v2 Robot)

This is the CAD for the second robot from the FTC Team 20077, The Indubitables for the 2024-2025 FTC Robotics Season, Into The Deep, available as a Fusion link.

This robot is meant to give many new rookies and existing teams ideas this season, or seasons beyond, on some ideas you can create or replicate with your robot.

## Drivetrain

This robot features a very small drivetrain with a size of 14 inches by 12.5 inches. It features a compact motor design with dead axle powered wheels. It also utilizes a dual dead wheel design alongside a GoBilda Pinpoint to aid with localization during the autonomous period. It also contains both Control Hub & Expansion Hub underneath the cover plate for easy wire management.

## Outtake

The outtake features 8 sets of Misumi SAR 230 slides powered by a GT2 belt pulley system. The outtake arm is powered by dual servos geared in a 36:40 for max speed and torque when scoring specimens onto the bar. There is also a differential wrist on the end of the arm that holds the claw and allows to score specimens both frontward & backwards, lowering cycle times.

## Intake

The intake is a very similar design to the outtake design of this robot. It also features an arm powered by a single servo however geared for max speed when grabbing samples from the field. It also features a differential wrist to grab various samples at different positions on the field. However, the 8 Misumi SAR 220 slides on the intake are powered by a two-bar linkage system that allows for quick extension and retraction for quick cycle times.

## Advantages
- Small form factor (14 in. x 12.5 in.)
- Simple power transmission throughout the design (Outtake, Intake, Drivetrain)
- Simple, yet effective design
